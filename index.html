                Thank you for visiting! <br>
                I write here only my personal theories. <br>&emsp; Some of them are proven and some will be someday I hope.
                Every idea and philosophy here is incomplete, they always will be. Beacuse we learn everyday and which I know as right today, it might not be same for tomorrow. We are the best creation among all, so why not we think bigger than we have been told to. My purpose is to express some of my thoughts on this page. I would appriciate your comments but I don't want to do it publicly so you can contact me. My contacts are given, just click on my name given below.
